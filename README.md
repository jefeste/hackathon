Slide – Presentation

Hi, I’m Jérémy Digard, and I worked on researching the idea and the move coding.

And I’m Robin Sanders. I worked on the website and the design.

Slide – Intro

SuInsure is a parametric insurance.
So what does this mean?: as soon as a measured indicator crosses a set threshold, compensation is triggered automatically. Meanwhile, DeFi puts the premiums to work (mutual fund).

Our objectives: fast compensation, trust by proof (not by promise), and easy secure access from anywhere in the world.

Slide – How it works (+ the demo)

The process happens through Slush, which offers great flexibility: either a simple connection with a zk-login account, or maximum security with a hot or cold wallet.

The insured customer selects a coverage, pays the premium, and it’s done — way faster than traditional insurance!

In addition, they will immediately receive proof of insurance: an on-chain NFT certificate that is traceable and tamper-proof.

Once the contract is set in place, an Oracle continuously checks public data. And if the threshold for the parameter is reached? The compensation goes straight to their wallet.

Meanwhile the pooled funds are being invested through DeFi. In the long run, we could operate through our own Sui validator node for optimal security.

Slide – Accessible everywhere

Why does insurance need to be universal? 

Climate change increased farmers’ losses: last year, 1 hundred 23 billion dollars worth of crops are lost— that’s only the beginning. Crop failure is no longer a risk that can be ignored.

Take Julius, a farmer living in Malawi who is unbanked.
With Suinsure, he could have been compensated for losing his tomato crops to the drought (draowt) this summer. By subscribing to insurance, he would avoid falling into a spiral of debt.

(Include Julius’s photo from the article in the slides, with a caption to show he’s a real person, not invented.)

The worst part? 50% of farmers remain unbanked, Julius’s case is only one of many.
Our goal is to make insurance coverage accessible for everyone, everywhere using the blockchain!

Slide – Fast reimbursement

Another great advantage of Suinsure is the speed of compensation. You might be asking yourself why speed of compensation is so important?

In the U.S., for example, more than 110 thousand restaurants closed in 2020 due to Covid 19. Why?, you may ask: restaurants have only about 16 days of cash reserves on median. Waiting 60 to 90 days for compensation isn’t a possibility for most. A faster insurance would make a massive difference, avoiding large scale losses of small businesses.

As you know, Sui has ultra-low latency in its transactions, just under 300 thousand per second. This means that even in times of saturation, compensation payments will be able to go through smoothly, with predictable fees.

Conclusion:


Thanks to the Sui blockchain, Suinsure takes parametric insurance to a whole new level of efficiency, optimizing accessibility, speed and trust. In addition, DeFi guarantees stable revenue, increasing the profit and decreasing the risk. All of these attributes serve as a motor for large scale adoption.
